# Serenade
(write project description here)

## It's a WIP
Started as a copy of my pset6 to have structure and imports, etc. If there's lingering things, we'll catch them as we implement this.

## TODO by 4/16: (update this list with each deadline that approaches)
- Outline Classes
    - Barrel Class
- Basic Map
- Basic Player movement
    - Pass down arrow key calls to correct classes
- Interval Quiz Sounds
- Barrels Spawn and Movement
- Know when player interacts with Barrels (callback function)
- Ask about getting a controller and how to add that (instead of keyboard)

# DONE
- Outline Classes
    - Start Screen
    - Playing Screen
    - ...
- Import kivy things

### Organization
