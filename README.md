# Serenade
(write project description here)

## It's a WIP
Started as a copy of my pset6 to have structure and imports, etc. If there's lingering things, we'll catch them as we implement this.

## TODO by 4/16: (update this list with each deadline that approaches)
- Basic Player movement
    - Pass down arrow key calls to correct classes
- Interval Quiz Sounds
- Ask about getting a controller and how to add that (instead of keyboard)
